      <h2>About Me</h2>
              
<p>
<strong>About Me:</strong><br>
Hi there! I’m Aaditya Raj — a finance and accounting enthusiast, strategic thinker, and someone who believes numbers tell stories if you know how to read them. Ever wondered how a balance sheet could be as thrilling as a debate? That’s where I come in.<br><br>

<strong>Education:</strong><br>
I’ve built a strong foundation in finance, accounting, and business management. From mastering Tally, GST, and corporate taxation to exploring financial modeling, I love turning theory into action. And yes, I’ve survived late-night spreadsheet marathons without losing my sense of humor — sometimes.<br><br>

<strong>Professional Skills:</strong><br>
Accounts, corporate finance, taxation, bookkeeping, and financial analysis — my playground. I thrive on reconciling accounts, projecting taxes, and uncovering insights hidden in numbers. But I also lead teams, mentor juniors, and orchestrate projects like national-level debates and MUNs. Think of me as someone who blends spreadsheets with strategy.<br><br>

<strong>Soft Skills:</strong><br>
Communication is my superpower. Debating, leading Pravaad, mentoring teams — these experiences sharpened my negotiation, persuasion, and storytelling abilities. I ask questions, challenge assumptions, and inspire action, all while keeping professionalism intact (and a bit of humor handy, because who likes a boring meeting?).<br><br>

<strong>Interests & Hobbies:</strong><br>
I’m fascinated by technology, AI, and FinTech — if it’s new and innovative, I’m curious. I care deeply about sustainability and try to bring environmentally conscious practices wherever I go. I love mentoring, solving problems creatively, and yes, occasionally cracking finance jokes to make work fun. After all, even spreadsheets deserve a smile.<br><br>

<strong>Philosophy:</strong><br>
I believe in balancing professionalism with personality, numbers with narratives, and skills with impact. I aim to make every interaction meaningful — whether it’s analyzing financial statements, leading a debate, or exploring new tech trends. So, if you’re looking for someone who can crunch numbers, communicate effectively, and sprinkle in a little wit, congratulations — you’ve found me!
